# School Management API

A secure, production-ready REST API built in Go for managing core school operations, including students, teachers, and executive/admin staff. The project follows a clean layered architecture, emphasizes security, and is built entirely on Go's standard library without external routing frameworks.

---

# Features

- **RESTful API** built using Go's standard library (`net/http`)

- **JWT Authentication** — stateless, token-based authentication with configurable token expiry

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — only executives (Execs) authenticate. Six privileged roles have full access while any other authenticated exec is limited to read-only (`GET`) operations

- **Password Reset Flow** — secure, time-limited reset tokens for credential recovery

- **HTTPS/TLS Support** — configurable through SSL certificates

- **API Root Endpoint** — exposes API metadata, version, status, and documentation link through `GET /`

- **Security-first middleware pipeline**
  - CORS
  - Security Headers
  - HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) Protection
  - Input Sanitization
  - Rate Limiting
  - Gzip Compression
  - Response Time Logging

- **Complete resource management**
  - Students CRUD
  - Teachers CRUD
  - Executives (Execs) CRUD

- **Repository Pattern** — SQL logic separated from HTTP handlers

- **Layered Architecture** — handlers, repositories, models, routers, and middleware remain isolated and maintainable

- **Environment-based configuration** using `.env`

# Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered request lifecycle.

```text
Request
   │
   ▼
Middleware Chain
(CORS → Security Headers → Rate Limiter → HPP → Sanitization → JWT → Compression → Response Time)
   │
   ▼
Router
   │
   ▼
Handler
   │
   ▼
Repository (sqlconnect)
   │
   ▼
Database
   │
   ▼
Response
```

### Layers

- **Router** maps incoming HTTP requests to their corresponding handlers.

- **Handlers** validate requests, decode payloads, perform business logic, and communicate with the repository layer.

- **Repositories** isolate database access from application logic and contain all SQL operations.

- **Models** define the application's core entities.

- **Middlewares** provide cross-cutting functionality such as authentication, security, logging, compression, and rate limiting.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or newer
- MySQL
- OpenSSL (only required for generating local TLS certificates)

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BurhaanAshraf/school-management-api
cd SCHOOL-MANAGEMENT-API
```

---

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create or update:

```text
cmd/api/.env
```

```dotenv
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=

API_PORT=

JWT_SECRET=
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=
RESET_TOKEN_EXP_DURATION=

CERT_FILE=
KEY_FILE=
```

| Variable                   | Description                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `DB_HOST`                  | Database host               |
| `DB_PORT`                  | Database port               |
| `DB_USER`                  | Database username           |
| `DB_PASSWORD`              | Database password           |
| `DB_NAME`                  | Database name               |
| `API_PORT`                 | API server port             |
| `JWT_SECRET`               | Secret used to sign JWTs    |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`           | JWT expiry duration         |
| `RESET_TOKEN_EXP_DURATION` | Password reset token expiry |
| `CERT_FILE`                | SSL certificate             |
| `KEY_FILE`                 | SSL private key             |

> Never commit a populated `.env` file. Keep it inside `.gitignore` and use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
go mod download
```

Since `go.mod` and `go.sum` are committed, this installs the exact dependency versions used by the project.

---

## 4. Run the Server

```bash
go run cmd/api/server.go
```

The server starts on the port configured by `API_PORT`.

You can verify that the API is running by visiting:

```text
GET /
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "name": "School Management API",
  "status": "running",
  "version": "1.0",
  "docs": "https://github.com/BurhaanAshraf/school-management-api"
}
```

---

# Authentication & Authorization

Every protected endpoint requires a valid JWT.

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The following endpoints are public:

- `POST /execs/login`
- `POST /execs/forgotpassword`
- `POST /execs/reset/resetpassword/{resetcode}`

All Student and Teacher endpoints require an authenticated Executive account.

## Role-Based Access

The following executive roles have full permissions:

- `super_admin`
- `principal`
- `vice_principal`
- `registrar`
- `student_affairs`
- `secretary`

These roles may perform:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

Any authenticated executive outside these roles is restricted to **read-only (`GET`)** operations.

## Additional Authentication Details

- JWT expiry is configurable using `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`.

- Password reset uses secure, time-limited reset codes.

- `/execs/logout` invalidates the current session.

- `/execs/{id}/updatepassword` allows an authenticated executive to change their password.

# Security

The API is protected by a layered security pipeline.

- JWT Authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- HTTPS/TLS Support
- Security Headers
- CORS
- HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) Protection
- Input Sanitization
- Rate Limiting
- Gzip Response Compression
- Response Time Logging

Every incoming request passes through the middleware chain before reaching the router, ensuring authentication, validation, sanitization, and logging are consistently applied across the application.
